Problem 1)
y = -70.4951 + 4.7311(Output) + 0.0036(Pr_Labor) + 0.28(Pr_Capital) + 0.7835(Pr_Fuel)

Problem 2)

Problem 3)
The sign of the intercept does not meet my previous expectations, as it is negative and this is a cost production function, so negative costs are not viable/real; however, since this is only the intercept, it seems both viable and realistic.

For the price variables, however, the signs make perfect sense because a negative sign on labor, capital, or fuel (when producing energy) would make no sense. You don't have workers paying to work for you or consume negative fuel.

Problem 4) *****

The Elasticity of Cost w.r.t is equal to 1.335. This means that for every 1% increase/decrease in fuel will lead to a 1% increase/decrease in Cost.
