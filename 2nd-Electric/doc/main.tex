\section{Problem 1}
\begin{center}
$\hat{y} = -70.4951 + 4.7311\upbeta_O + 0.0036\upbeta_L + 0.28\upbeta_K + 0.7835\upbeta_F$
\end{center}

\section{Problem 2}
$\hat{y}$ (or the Cost function) is well-reflected by this model. When producing $0$ units, the firm will suffer a loss of $70$ million dollars. Due to overheads, anything other than negative would be out-of-place. 

\vspace{5mm}
\noindent
$\upbeta_O$ (or the estimate of Output) is the predominate driver within this regression model. At a value of $4.7311$, output leads the cost estimate.

\vspace{5mm}
\noindent
$\upbeta_L$ (or the estimate of Labor) is on the less contributing side to the overall cost of production. 

\vspace{5mm}
\noindent
$\upbeta_K$ (or the estimate of Capital) is the least intensive factor of production, so for every unit of energy produced, capita--overall--doesn't heavily contribute to the cost.

\section{Problem 3}

The sign of the output ($\upbeta_O$) makes perfect sense, as overhead costs exist, so whenever the firm is not producing electricity, they will be suffering losses.

\vspace{5mm}
\noindent
For the price variables, as well, the signs make perfect sense because a negative sign on labor, capital, or fuel (when producing energy) would make no sense. You don't have workers paying to work for you and negative consumption of fuel is impossible).

\section{Problem 4}
$\upbeta_O$ (or the estimate of Output) is the predominate driver within this regression model. At a value of $4.7311$, output leads the cost estimate when not factoring in the static overhead cost.

\vspace{5mm}
\noindent
The Elasticity of Cost w.r.t the price of Fuel is equal to 1.335. This means that for every $1\%$ increase/decrease in fuel will lead to a $1\%$ increase/decrease in Cost.
