# Classwork
Repository to track my projects for my econometrics and finance classes.

Mainly what is in here right now is just stuff for my Econometrics and Forecasting Class.

TODO:
  1.) Using LaTeX create answer sheets. I didn't do this in class, but I should have.
  2.) Ensure everything is working properly.
