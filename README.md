# Classwork
Repository to track my projects for my economics, econometrics, finance 
and statisticsclasses. PLEASE NOTE: I am now graduated with a Bachelors 
in Economics and I focused highly on the financial economic side of 
economics.

Mainly what is in here right now is just stuff for my Econometrics and 
Forecasting Class. Albeit, I'm slowly adding papers from my investments 
class as time progresses.

A brief summary of each project:
The first project is from an econometrics class where we were discussing
the correlation between CEO salaries (and total compensation) with 
their length of employment with a company. Oddly enough, it was shown that
more often than not, CEOs who had higher longevity with their company
tended not to have the highest salaries.

The second project was an introduction to multiple linear regression analysis
of electric data. For this project, I switched to using LaTeX and I'm 
incredibly happy with how the final product turned out! See:

The third project listed "Effects of ..." is a report on how economic release
data effects stock opening and closing prices. If you would like to see
my findings, then please read from section three of my paper:

Finally, the last project listed is a report on Monsanto's earnings. I mainly
used R and LaTeX for this paper and, once again, I'm very happy with how the 
formatting came out. As well, I wrote my personal opinions of how their report
data effects overall market health:
