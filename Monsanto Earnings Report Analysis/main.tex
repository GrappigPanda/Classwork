\section{Earnings per Share}
By Monsanto's estimates, their Earnings per Share ($2.92 \$ $) has reamained within their estimates, but fallen over the course of the year toward the lower end of their acceptable range. A factor assumed to be heavily affecting both Monsanto and the US economy as a whole is the strengthening of the dollar in relations to other currencies--notably the Euro.
